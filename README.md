# Geometry Utilities Project

This project provides basic mathematical utilities to calculate geometric properties such as the hypotenuse of a right triangle and the area of a circle. These functions are defined in the `geo.utils` module and can be useful in a variety of mathematical and scientific computations.

## Features

- **Calculate Hypotenuse**: Computes the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two sides.
- **Calculate Circle Area**: Computes the area of a circle given its radius.
